## Saudi Font Web Integration

I created this GitHub repository to make it easier to use the official Saudi Font in web projects and other applications. The font files were downloaded from the official website announced by the Ministry of Culture:  
[https://engage.moc.gov.sa/e/fonts/saudi-font/?lang=ar](https://engage.moc.gov.sa/e/fonts/saudi-font/?lang=ar)

The goal of this repository is to simplify embedding all font weights using a single link, making integration smoother for developers and designers.
